# the script. MM helped with defining the convert() function.

# Because the input TXT file used here has specified the start and end timestamps in the format (S...)SS.ms(...[â‰¤3]),
# it should be converted to the HH:MM:SS.ms[...] format to be used for FFmpeg in CMD, hence the following convert()
# function definition. The function will convert into hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds. If days are needed,
# additional calculations must be done (for days and ensuring that the hours do not exceed 24 hours.) This function
# requires a real number as an input, not a string. If the input is based on a TXT file string, and the milliseconds
# must be intact, try using float("str"). int("str") will give an error message like: "ValueError: invalid literal
# for int( ) with base 10: "1858.893"" Note that the output formatting might be necessary to customise further;
# "%02d" and "%d" do not output the same amount of digits. "%d" is a placeholder for a decimal integer (which are
# necessary for the function calculations), while "%s" is a placeholder for string values.

    seconds = (seconds - hour * 3600) - (minutes * 60)

# n = float("1858.893") # Must coerce string into float number because of the input TXT list.
# n = 1858.893 # If "n = "1858.893"", then "TypeError: must be real number, not str".
# print(convert(n))
# (Given the value of n above, the function should yield: "00:30:58.893")

# Specify the input and output folders. The input folder should contain any audio or video file and file(s) containing
# the start and end timestamps that the script will use during slicing/trimming.

# In this input TXT file, the input audio file corresponds in part to the Informant number. Therefore,
# the input audio file for FFmpeg is given as "InputDir + Informant + ".wav"". If the input TXT file instead has the
# audio filename itself, e.g., AudioFilename = "OS03.wav" instead of Informant = "OS03", then the output filename
# must be customised differently, e.g., "AudioFilename[:-4] + UniqueNumb + "AudioFilename[-4:]" (i.e., here adding
# UniqueNumb between the filename and its ".wav" extension.) The script also presupposes that all the lines in the
# TXT file will be used for the slicing; it does not filter a subset of rows.
